# *Prospective Directions for the National High School Ethics Bowl (NHSEB)*
## Class: Geospatial Analysis (GEOS 5010)
### Term Project

As one of the term projects for my introductory geospatial analysis course, I analyzed data given to me by the director of the NHSEB to help inform future decisions regarding the expansion of his program.

For the analysis, I used ArcGIS Pro 2.7. The report needed to be less than a 1000 words, so I couldn't do as much as I had originally intended. However, I have uploaded my final submission to demonstrate beginner to intermediate competency in spatial analysis and ArcGIS Pro.
